# Integrate Multiple Azure Subscriptions within a Tenant

The following example integrates multiple Azure subscriptions within a
single Azure tenant with Lacework for Activity Log analysis.

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  features {}
}

provider "lacework" {}

module "az_activity_log" {
  source  = "lacework/activity-log/azure"
  version = "~> 3.0"

  subscription_ids = [
    "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
    "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
    "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003"
  ]
}
```
